  - **Vite**: Fast build tool for modern web apps, offering faster development and HMR.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for flexible, responsive design.

- **Backend**:
  - **AWS Amplify (Gen 2)**: Code-first backend framework for creating real-time APIs, hosting, and deployment.
  - **GraphQL API**: Real-time data fetching using **Amplify Data** with DynamoDB integration.
  - **AWS Lambda**: Serverless function used to fetch data from the **YouTube Data API** and update the website with new videos and content.
  - **CI/CD**: Integrated with **GitHub** for automatic deployment to AWS.

### **Key Features**

- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop using **Tailwind CSS**.
- **Real-time Data**: Dynamic show content (e.g., reviews, videos) fetched from **AWS Amplifyâ€™s GraphQL API**.
- **Automated Updates**: **AWS Lambda** fetches data from the **YouTube Data API** daily, ensuring the site always displays the latest videos and content.
- **Modular Components**: Reusable **React components** for easy updates and maintenance.
- **API Integration**: Uses **Amplify Data** to connect and display data (show details, reviews, etc.).
- **Fast Development**: Optimized with **Vite** for rapid build times and fast hot module replacement (HMR).
